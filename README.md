# MassRobotics Autonomous Mobile Robot Interoperability Standard

[![MassRobotics AMR Interop](https://www.massrobotics.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/AMR_interop_MR-logo-scaled.jpg)](https://www.massrobotics.org/project/amrinteroperability/)

The MassRobotics AMR Interoperability Standard aims to help enable organizations to deploy autonomous mobile robots AMRs from multiple vendors and have them coexist effectively, better realizing the promise of warehouse and factory automation. This standard will allow autonomous vehicles of different types to share information about their robot(s) location, speed, direction, health, tasking / availability and other performance characteristics with other similar vehicles to help them be better teammates on a warehouse or factory floor.  Furthermore, it allows human agents to provide a similar set of information (through the use of external mobile devices) so that their work can be orchestrated alongside robots.

This project contains a schema definition file (AMR_Interop_Standard.json); a detailed description of the standard (AMR_Interop_Standard.pdf); an example implemetation of a client (MassRobotics-AMR-Sender), and a server (MassRobotics-AMR-Receiver); as well as some example messages.  The client and server each have their own README files describing their installation and usage.
